A notes web application built using AWS Amplify, with authentication allowing users to sign up, sign in, and manage their account. The app also has a scalable GraphQL API configured with an Amazon DynamoDB database, allowing users to create and delete notes. Also added file storage using Amazon S3 so that users can upload images and view them in the app. ðŸŽ¯
